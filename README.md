# Syncify

Syncify is a gem used to sync records and associations you specify from one remote ActiveRecord environment to your local environment.

Consider this hypothetical problem: You have a gigantic production database with complex associations between your models, including polymorphic associations. The database includes sensitive data that shouldn't really be in your development or staging environments. But, there's something wrong in production and you need production data to be able to debug it. It's not practical, efficient, safe, or generally advisable to restore a backup of the production database locally.

How do you get that data safely from production to an environment where you can make use of it? This is the problem that Syncify aims to address.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'syncify'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install syncify

## Usage

Syncify doesn't require Rails, just ActiveRecord, but it's a reasonable foundation for the following examples.

Also, you can sync from any environment to whatever your current environment is. So, you could sync from your staging environment to your client test environment or from staging to development. Heck, you could go from staging to prod if you'd like.

For the purposes of this documentation we'll assume that you're syncing data in a Rails app from production to your local development environment.

Syncify has a pretty simple API. There's just one method, `run!`. Here's a really basic example where we're syncing a single `Widget` from production to the current environment. The current environment could be any environment, but we'll assume it's development for this documentation.

```ruby
Syncify::Sync.run!(klass: Widget, id: 123, remote_database: :production)
```

Boom! You've copied `Widget` 123 to local dev. The widget will have all the same values including its `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, etc values. The above example assumes that the `Widget` doesn't have any foreign keys that don't exist locally.

Syncify also accepts a `where` argument in the form of any valid active record `where` expression (a hash or a string). Here's the same as above, but with a `where`:

```ruby
Syncify::Sync.run!(klass: Widget, where: { id: 123 }, remote_database: :production)
```

Or...


```ruby
Syncify::Sync.run!(klass: Widget, where: 'widgets.id = 123', remote_database: :production)
```

Now, let's say a `Widget` `belongs_to` a `Manufacturer`. Furthermore, let's say a `Manufacturer` `has_many` `Widget`s. We'll pretend we have this data in the prod database:

`widgets`:

| id  | name                                               | manufacturer_id |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 123 | Lubricated Stainless Steel Helical Insert          | 78              |
| 124 | Magnetic Contact Alarm Switches                    | 79              |
| 125 | Idler Sprocket for Double-Strand ANSI Roller Chain | 78              |
| 126 | Rod End Bolt Blank                                 | 79              |
| 127 | Press-Fit Drill Bushing                            | 78              |

`manufacturers`:

| id  | name                       |
| --- | -------------------------- |
| 78  | South Seas Trading Company |
| 79  | Blandco Manufacturing      |

If your database uses foreign keys and the production `Widget`'s `Manufacturer` doesn't exist locally then the example above would fail. To get around this we can specify an association to also sync when syncing the `Widget`.

```ruby
Syncify::Sync.run!(klass: Widget,
                   id: 123,
                   association: :manufacturer,
                   remote_database : :production)
```

Running the above example will copy two records into your local database:

* The `Widget` with id 123 (Lubricated Stainless Steel Helical Insert)
* The `Manufacturer` with id 78 (South Seas Trading Company)

It's important to note that Syncify _does not_ recursively follow associations. You'll note that not all of the the manufacturer's widgets were synced, only the one we specified.

The `association` attribute passed into the `run!` method can be any valid value that you might use when joining records with ActiveRecord. The above effectively becomes:

```ruby
Widget.eager_load(:manufacturer).find(123)
```

Because of this, you can pass any sort of ActiveRecord association into Syncify's `run!` method.

Now let's imagine that a `Manufacturer` `has_many` `Plant`s which `belong_to` a `State`. Here are some example rows in these tables:

`plants`:

| id  | name            | manufacturer_id | city    | state_id |
| --- | --------------- | --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 64  | Rapid Run       | 78              | Lansing | 13       |
| 65  | Ye Olde Factory | 78              | Naples  | 15       |
| 66  | Catco           | 79              | Balston | 43       |

`states`:

| id  | name     |
| --- | -------- |
| 13  | Michigan |
| 15  | Florida  |
| 43  | Virginia |

We could sync a `Manufacturer` along with its widgets, factories, and the state the factory is in with this example:

```ruby
Syncify::Sync.run!(klass: Manufacturer,
                   id: 78,
                   association: [
                     :widgets,
                     { factories: :state }
                   ],
                   remote_database: :production)
```

You can really go wild with the associations; well beyond what you could normally run with an ActiveRecord query! In one app I have a hash defining a ton of associations across dozens of models that is more than 150 lines long. When I run this sync it identifies more than 500 records and syncs them all to local dev in about 30 seconds.

### Polymorphic Associations

Syncify also works with (and across) Polymorphic associations! To sync across polymorphic associations you need to specify an association using the `Syncify::PolymorphicAssociation` class. This is put in place in your otherwise-normal associations.

Let's imagine that we run an online store that sells both physical and digital goods. A given invoice then might have line items that refer to either type of good.

Here's our model:

* `Customer`
	* `has_many :invoices`
* `Invoice`
	* `belongs_to :customer`
	* `has_many :line_items`
* `LineItem`
	* `belongs_to :invoice`
	* `belongs_to :product, polymorphic: true`
* `DigitalProduct`
	* `has_many :line_items, as: :product`
	* `belongs_to :category`
* `PhysicalProduct`
	* `has_many :line_items, as: :product`
	* `belongs_to :distributor`
* `Category`
	* `has_many :digital_products`
* `Distributor`
	* `has_many :physical_products`

There's a lot going on above, and I'll spare you the example database tables. You can use your imagination! ðŸ˜‰

Let's say we want to sync a particular `LineItem`. With ActiveRecord queries you can't simply `eager_load` across a polymorphic association, much less to any sub-associations (EG: category or distributor). With Syncify you can.

Here's an example. For simplicity's sake it assumes that the database doesn't use foreign keys. (Don't worry, we'll do a more complex example next!):

```ruby
Syncify::Sync.run!(klass: Customer,
                   id: 999,
                   association: Syncify::PolymorphicAssociation.new(
                     :product,
                     DigitalProduct => {},
                     PhysicalProduct => {}
                   ),
                   remote_database: :production)
```

Assuming that line item 42's product is a `DigitalProduct`, this example would have synced the `LineItem` and its `DigitalProduct` and nothing else.

The `Syncify::PolymorphicAssociation` is saying that, for the `LineItem`'s `product` polymorphic association, when the product is a `DigitalProduct`, sync it with the specified associations (in this case none). When the product is a `PhysicalProduct`, sync it with the specified associations (again, none in this case).

Now let's say that we want to sync a specific `Customer` and all of their invoices and the related products. IE: the whole kit and caboodle. Here's how you can do it:

```ruby
Syncify::Sync.run!(klass: Customer,
                   id: 999,
                   association: {
                     invoices: {
                       line_items: Syncify::PolymorphicAssociation.new(
                         :product,
                         DigitalProduct => :category,
                         PhysicalProduct => :distributor
                       )
                     }
                   },
                   remote_database: :production)
```

This will sync a customer, all of their invoices, all of those invoice's line items. It goes on to sync all of the line item's products, whether digital or physical, as well as the digital product's category and the physical product's distributor.

### Callbacks

Sometimes production databases contain sensitive data that you really don't want to have end up in other environments. Or, maybe you want to disassociate production data from third party production APIs. Or maybe you want to download images before you actually create image records locally. Syncify handles this by providing a callback mechanism.

Syncify's workflow is basically this:

1. Using the specified class and its associations, Syncify identifies all of the records we need to sync to the local environment. Effectively, all of the records are loaded from the remote environment into a set in memory.
2. Syncify calls an optional `callback` proc you can pass into the `run!` method.
3. Syncify actually bulk inserts all of the identified records into the local database.

By providing a `callback` proc, you can take some sort of action after all of the remote data has been identified, but before you write it locally. This includes modifying the remote data (in memory, not actually in the remote database).

Here's an example that masks personally identifiable information for users:

```ruby
Syncify::Sync.run!(klass: User,
                   id: 40,
                   remote_database: :production,
                   callback:
                     proc do |identified_records|
                       user = identified_records.find { |record| record.class == User }
                       user.first_name = "#{user.first_name.first}#{'*' * (user.first_name.size - 1)}"
                       user.last_name = "#{user.last_name.first}#{'*' * (user.last_name.size - 1)}"
                     end
```
